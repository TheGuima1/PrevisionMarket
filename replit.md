# Palpites.AI - Plataforma de Prediction Markets com BRL3

## Overview
Palpites.AI is a prediction market platform, inspired by Polymarket, designed for the Brazilian market. Users deposit via PIX, receive BRL3 tokens on-chain, and use them to trade on future events. The project aims to provide a robust, user-friendly, and localized platform for prediction markets, with ambitions for real-time features, advanced trading tools, and decentralized integration in future phases. The MVP is complete, featuring AMM-based pricing (CPMM with 2% spread), decimal odds, trade preview system, full PT-BR localization, and a production-ready deployment. The business vision is to capture the Brazilian prediction market, offering a localized and accessible platform with high market potential due to the integration of PIX and a familiar user experience.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform follows a **Purple Tech Masculino** design with neutral gray-purple backgrounds (#F5F3F8), deep saturated purple accents (#6B3FE8), and action colors (deep purple #6B3FE8 for YES, deep red #E8334F for NO). The design prioritizes **masculine appeal** for male predicters, **tech seriousness**, and **financial expertise** through deeper tones, stronger saturation, and less pastel colors. Typography includes Inter for body text, Manrope for headings, and Roboto Mono for numerical values. Light mode features neutral gray-purple backgrounds with subtle gradients (#F8F6FA to #F0EDF5); dark mode uses deep purple backgrounds (260 30% 8%) with brighter purple accents. YES/NO buttons feature deep saturated colors with strong hover effects. All components strictly follow `design_guidelines.md`, ensuring masculine tech consistency, professional appeal, Shadcn UI component usage, elevation system, full responsiveness, and visual states for loading, error, and empty content.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) via Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with sessions
- **BRL3 Token Integration (3BIT XChange)**: Hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture where PIX deposits trigger BRL3 token mints on-chain and withdrawals trigger burns. The integration uses HTTP webhooks (`server/brl3-client.ts`) to notify the 3BIT XChange system of deposit/withdrawal events. BRL3 tokens have a guaranteed 1:1 BRL peg within the app, but no external blockchain conversion rate. The system maintains dual ledgers: Palpites.AI PostgreSQL (off-chain trading) and 3BIT blockchain ledger (token custody). Configuration via `BRL3_API_URL` and `BRL3_API_KEY` secrets. **Current XCHANGE URL**: `https://x-change-palpites-ai-TheGuima1.replit.app` (Polygon network, dedicated token for Palpites.AI, no external liquidity). **Polygon Admin Wallet (Conta-Mãe)**: `0xcd83c3f36396bcb3569240a3cb34f037ba310926` (receives all BRL3 tokens, managed by XCHANGE internally - not passed in API payloads). **Integration Details**: (1) Mint endpoint: `POST /api/palpites/mint` with payload `{externalUserId, amountBrl}` returns `{success:true}` on HTTP 200; (2) Burn endpoint: `POST /api/palpites/burn` with payload `{externalUserId, amountBrl}` returns `{success:true}` on HTTP 200; (3) Authentication: `x-api-key` header with shared secret; (4) All operations include detailed logging with emoji indicators for debugging (📦 payload, ✅ success, ❌ errors); (5) Integration is production-ready with proper error handling and does not block Palpites.AI operations if XCHANGE API fails; (6) Tested and functional: MINT and BURN operations confirmed working with HTTP 200 responses.
- **Manual Deposit Approval Workflow (MVP)**: Deposits require admin approval before BRL3 minting. Users upload PDF proof files (5MB max) via Portfolio page with client-side and server-side validation. Files are stored in `uploads/deposit-proofs/` with UUID-based filenames. Admins review pending deposits in Admin Panel ("Depósitos" tab), download proof PDFs for verification, and approve/reject each request. Upon approval, the system triggers BRL3 minting via `notifyMintToBRL3()` and updates user balance. Upon rejection, proof files are deleted from filesystem. Database table `pending_deposits` tracks lifecycle (pending/approved/rejected status) with `proofFilePath` column. Security features include: file type validation (PDF only), size limits (5MB), path traversal protection, orphaned file cleanup on errors/rejections, and file accessibility checks. Known MVP limitations: (1) Approved deposit files persist indefinitely without automatic cleanup/archival, (2) BRL3 minting is not fully transactional (file may persist if mint fails after DB insert).
- **Dynamic Market Management (Nov 15, 2025)**: Admin panel now supports dynamic creation, validation, and removal of Polymarket-mirrored markets via database-driven architecture. Admin can add any Polymarket market by slug with real-time odds preview (showing YES/NO probabilities and volume) before creation. Mirror worker (`server/mirror/worker.ts`) automatically detects new markets from database (origin='polymarket') every 60s and begins syncing odds. Validation endpoint (`POST /api/admin/markets/validate-slug`) fetches 500 active markets from Polymarket Gamma API with 5min cache, filters locally by slug (case-insensitive), and returns preview data. Creation endpoint (`POST /api/admin/markets/mirror`) initializes AMM reserves based on current Polymarket odds. Deletion endpoint (`DELETE /api/admin/markets/:id`) cascades removal of amm_snapshots, polymarket_snapshots, orders, and positions to avoid foreign key violations. UI features "Espelhar Polymarket" tab in admin panel with slug input, real-time validation, odds preview card, and active markets list with remove buttons. Currently 4 markets active (3 valid, 1 archived on Polymarket).
- **Polymarket Adapter (Updated)**: Fetches market data from Gamma API (`https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?active=true&closed=false&limit=500`) instead of per-slug queries (unsupported by Gamma). Implements 5-minute cache to avoid excessive API calls. Extracts YES probability from outcomes array by name matching (case-insensitive) to handle varying outcome orders. Returns pure spot price (no spread - applied at execution).
- **Mirror Worker (Database-Driven)**: Refactored from hardcoded slugs to dynamic database queries. On startup, queries `markets` table for rows with `origin='polymarket'`, extracts `polymarketSlug` values, validates each slug with Polymarket API, and begins 60s polling interval. Auto-detects new markets added via admin panel and auto-removes slugs when markets are deleted. Logs show validation status and market count.
- **Prediction Market Core (AMM-based MVP)**: Implements dynamic AMM pricing using the Constant Product Market Maker formula with a 2% spread. A public `/api/orders/preview` endpoint provides real-time share estimates before trading. All orders are instantly filled.
- **Localization**: Full PT-BR localization for all UI elements and backend error messages.

- **AI Assistant (Cachorro)**: A floating chat powered by GPT-5 (via Replit AI Integrations) offering context-aware responses, quick actions, and market recommendations.
- **Admin Panel (Nov 15, 2025 - Dark UI Redesign)**: Completely redesigned with dark theme matching Purple Tech Masculine visual identity. Features fixed sidebar navigation (w-72, bg-[#2A2640]) with 10 menu items: Depósitos, Saques, Saldos, Mercados, Polymarket, Usuários, Histórico, Notificações, Relatórios, Configurações. Header displays admin wallet balance and connection status (bg-[#2A2640]). Main content area (bg-[#1F1B2E]) uses state-based navigation with currentView. Fully implemented views: (1) **Depósitos**: Two-column layout with pending deposits table and PDF proof preview, approve/reject buttons trigger BRL3 minting; (2) **Mercados**: Create manual markets form, resolve pending markets (YES/NO), list all markets with delete capability; (3) **Polymarket**: Validate Polymarket slugs with real-time odds preview, create mirrored markets, manage active mirrors; (4) **Usuários**: User table with balance display, detailed view showing transaction history. Dark theme uses #1F1B2E (main bg), #2A2640 (cards/sidebar), text-white, border-white/10. All interactive elements include data-testid attributes for E2E testing. Placeholder views for Saques, Saldos, Histórico, Notificações, Relatórios, Configurações show "Em desenvolvimento".

### System Design Choices
- **E2E Validation**: Extensive Playwright E2E tests cover critical user journeys and admin functions.
- **Cache Invalidation**: TanStack Query is configured for efficient cache invalidation.
- **Mocked Features**: Pix and Crypto payments, along with manual market resolution, are mocked for the MVP.
- **Pricing Strategy (Competitive Advantage)**: Palpites.AI uses Polymarket's "spot price" (consensus market price) from the Gamma API, not their execution price. This gives users ~10-15% better odds than Polymarket's execution price which includes their spread/slippage. For example: Polymarket spot 3.25% vs execution 3.7¢ = 12% better profit for Palpites.AI users. We charge only a transparent 2% platform fee on top of spot price. Tooltips in trade panel explain this advantage to users. Future enhancement: implement dual-price display showing both spot and estimated execution prices for complete transparency.
- **Production Deployment Optimization**: Mirror worker initialization and database seeding run asynchronously to prevent deployment health check timeouts. Server startup completes in ~5 seconds while Polymarket slug validation and initial data sync occur in the background without blocking. This ensures rapid deployment while maintaining data integrity.
- **Replit Autoscale Health Checks**: Three endpoints available: GET `/healthz` (ultra-fast, no DB queries), GET `/health` (with DB ping via SELECT 1), and frontend served via Express static/Vite middleware. Replit Autoscale checks any endpoint and expects fast responses. Server optimized for rapid startup: HTTP server listens on 0.0.0.0:5000, auto-seed and mirror worker run asynchronously to avoid blocking.
